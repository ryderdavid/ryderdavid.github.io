  Hi, I'm Ryder. I live in Washington, DC with my wife and a 72 lb Greyhound named Cole. I spend a ton of my free time thinking about how organizations can use tech to share nicely, remember things, make smart decisions, and waste less time. I'm pursuing a <a href="https://www.bu.edu/online/programs/graduate-programs/computer-information-systems-masters-degree/">Master of Science in Computer Information Systems from Boston University</a>, with course concentrations focusing on data analytics, databases and business intelligence, and IT management and strategy.
  <br><br>
  I have ten years' progressive experience in non-profit program and operational management, having worked primarily for (formerly) <a href="https://www.irex.org">IREX</a> and (currently) <a href="www.abarol.org">The American Bar Association</a>. I've worked through every role in the non-profit grant lifecycle, from logistical backstopping to design and budgeting, through implementation and monitoring, to managing staff and key relationships with funders, stakeholders, and vendors.
